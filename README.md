# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling in route handlers.  Specifically, a database query in the `/users/:id` route lacks proper error handling.  This can lead to application crashes or unexpected behavior if the database operation fails.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code. The route handler fetches user data from a database based on the provided ID. However, it doesn't handle potential errors during the database query.  If the query fails, the application might crash or return an incomplete response.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version.  It includes comprehensive error handling using a `try...catch` block to gracefully manage database errors.  Appropriate status codes are returned to inform the client about the error, improving the overall application resilience and user experience.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `node bug.js` and then make a request to `/users/someInvalidId` to see the error.
4. Then run `node bugSolution.js` and make the same request to see the corrected behavior.
